          <div class="sympazin_answers">
            Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of
            opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of
            drug-related <br />

            commonly involves concomitant use of other medications, alcohol,

            increases the risk of respiratory depression. Limit dosage and
            duration of <br />concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids and

            <br /><b> CNS Depressants and Alcohol:</b> Concomitant use of
            SYMPAZAN with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may increase
            the risk of sedation <br />

            <b>Drug Metabolized by CYP2D6:</b> SYMPAZAN inhibits CYP2D6,

            fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g.,
            omeprazole). <br />
            <b>Cannabidiol:</b> Coadministration of cannabidiol and SYMPAZAN may
